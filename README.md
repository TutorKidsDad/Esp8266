## Projects Overview

1. **DHT11 Sensor Monitoring**
   - Monitors temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor.
   - Displays data on an I2C LCD.
   - Provides a local web server for accessing sensor data.

2. **Ultrasonic Distance Measurement**
   - Measures distance using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.
   - Outputs data to a web page and/or LCD display.

3. **LoRa Communication**
   - Controls motors wirelessly using LoRa technology.
   - Sends and receives motor control signals.

4. **Wi-Fi Controlled Robot**
   - A remote-controlled robot using a web interface.
   - Integrates motor control with ESP8266 and joystick input.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the projects:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/esp8266-projects.git

    Open the project folder in the Arduino IDE.

    Install the required libraries as specified for each project.

Components Required

Depending on the project, the following components may be required:

    ESP8266 Module (e.g., NodeMCU, Wemos D1 Mini)
    DHT11 Sensor
    HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
    I2C 16x2 LCD
    LoRa Module (if applicable)
    Motor Driver (for motor control projects)
    Jumper wires
    Breadboard (optional)

Libraries Required

Each project may require specific libraries. Common libraries include:
