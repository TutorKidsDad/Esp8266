In this code, the ESP8266 first tries to read the WiFi credentials (SSID, password) and the ThingSpeak API key from the EEPROM. If the EEPROM is empty or contains invalid data, it triggers a sequence to allow the user to set these credentials via a web interface. Here’s how it works step by step:

### 1. **Reading from EEPROM at Startup**:
When the ESP8266 starts up, it runs the `readCredentialsFromEEPROM()` function:

```cpp
void readCredentialsFromEEPROM() {
  ssid = readStringFromEEPROM(0, 32);
  password = readStringFromEEPROM(32, 64);
  channelAPIKey = readStringFromEEPROM(64, 96);
  
  if (ssid.length() == 0) ssid = defaultSSID;
  if (password.length() == 0) password = defaultPassword;
  if (channelAPIKey.length() == 0) channelAPIKey = defaultChannelAPIKey;
}
```

- **EEPROM Memory Layout**: 
  - SSID is stored at addresses 0–31.
  - Password is stored at addresses 32–63.
  - ThingSpeak API Key is stored at addresses 64–95.
  
- If the stored SSID, password, or API key is empty (i.e., no valid data is present in EEPROM), it uses default values. These defaults are hardcoded into the code as `defaultSSID`, `defaultPassword`, and `defaultChannelAPIKey`.

### 2. **Attempting to Connect to WiFi**:
After reading the credentials, the ESP8266 attempts to connect to WiFi using the retrieved SSID and password:

```cpp
WiFi.begin(ssid.c_str(), password.c_str());
if (connectToWiFi()) {
  Serial.println("Connected to WiFi!");
} else {
  Serial.println("Failed to connect. Setting up AP...");
  setupAccessPoint();
  setupWebServer();
}
```

- If the connection is successful (`WiFi.status() == WL_CONNECTED`), the ESP8266 proceeds with its normal operation.
- If it fails to connect after a few attempts, it switches to **Access Point (AP) Mode**.

### 3. **Setting Up an Access Point**:
If the credentials are not present (or incorrect) in the EEPROM, and the ESP8266 fails to connect to WiFi, it switches to AP mode:

```cpp
void setupAccessPoint() {
  WiFi.softAP("ESP8266_Config");
  Serial.println("Access Point created. Connect to it to set credentials.");
}
```

- The ESP8266 creates a WiFi network named **"ESP8266_Config"**. 
- You can connect to this network using any device (e.g., smartphone, laptop) to configure the WiFi credentials and ThingSpeak API key.

### 4. **Web Server for Configuration**:
The ESP8266 also starts a web server to allow users to input the SSID, password, and ThingSpeak API key via a web form.

```cpp
void setupWebServer() {
  server.on("/", []() {
    String html = "<html><body><h1>ESP8266 WiFi Config</h1>"
                  "<form action='/save' method='POST'>"
                  "SSID: <input type='text' name='ssid'><br>"
                  "Password: <input type='text' name='password'><br>"
                  "ThingSpeak API Key: <input type='text' name='apikey'><br>"
                  "<input type='submit' value='Save'></form></body></html>";
    server.send(200, "text/html", html);
  });

  server.on("/save", []() {
    ssid = server.arg("ssid");
    password = server.arg("password");
    channelAPIKey = server.arg("apikey");

    // Save credentials to EEPROM
    saveCredentialsToEEPROM();

    String response = "Credentials saved. Rebooting...";
    server.send(200, "text/html", response);
    delay(2000);
    ESP.restart();  // Reboot to apply new settings
  });

  server.begin();
  Serial.println("Web server started.");
}
```

- When you navigate to the root page (`"/"`) of the web server (via the IP provided by the ESP8266, usually `192.168.4.1`), a form appears.
- This form asks for the SSID, password, and ThingSpeak API key. After entering this information and clicking "Save", the ESP8266 saves the data into the EEPROM and reboots.

### 5. **Saving the Credentials to EEPROM**:
When you submit the form, the ESP8266 saves the new credentials to EEPROM using the `saveCredentialsToEEPROM()` function:

```cpp
void saveCredentialsToEEPROM() {
  writeStringToEEPROM(0, ssid);
  writeStringToEEPROM(32, password);
  writeStringToEEPROM(64, channelAPIKey);
  EEPROM.commit();
}
```

- It writes the SSID to addresses 0–31, the password to addresses 32–63, and the ThingSpeak API key to addresses 64–95.
- After saving, it commits the changes with `EEPROM.commit()` and reboots the device.

### 6. **Reboot and Use New Credentials**:
After the ESP8266 restarts, it reads the newly stored credentials from EEPROM and attempts to connect to the WiFi network using the new SSID and password. If successful, it will continue with normal operation, and sensor data will be sent to ThingSpeak using the new API key.

### In Summary:
1. At startup, it reads credentials from EEPROM.
2. If the credentials are valid, it connects to WiFi.
3. If they are invalid or missing, it creates an AP and web server for input.
4. After entering the new credentials via the web form, it stores them in EEPROM and reboots.
5. On the next boot, the ESP8266 uses the newly saved credentials for WiFi and ThingSpeak.
