### **README for ESP8266 with MPU6050 and ThingSpeak Integration**

---

## **1. Project Overview**
This project demonstrates the use of an **ESP8266 WiFi module** and an **MPU6050 sensor** to capture accelerometer and gyroscope data, then upload the sensor readings to **ThingSpeak** for real-time monitoring. The MPU6050 provides 6-axis motion tracking, and the data is sent to the cloud via WiFi for storage and visualization.

---

## **2. Components Required**

- **ESP8266 (NodeMCU or similar)**
- **MPU6050 6-DOF (3-axis accelerometer + 3-axis gyroscope)**
- **Breadboard and jumper wires**
- **5V Power Supply**
- **Arduino IDE**
- **ThingSpeak Account**

---

## **3. Circuit Connections**

### **ESP8266 to MPU6050:**
- **VCC** of MPU6050 → **3.3V** of ESP8266
- **GND** of MPU6050 → **GND** of ESP8266
- **SDA** of MPU6050 → **D2 (GPIO 4)** of ESP8266
- **SCL** of MPU6050 → **D1 (GPIO 5)** of ESP8266

Ensure the MPU6050 is powered correctly with 3.3V (the ESP8266 typically does not provide 5V on its output pins).

### **Connections Summary:**

| MPU6050 Pin | ESP8266 Pin |
|-------------|-------------|
| VCC         | 3.3V        |
| GND         | GND         |
| SDA         | D2 (GPIO 4) |
| SCL         | D1 (GPIO 5) |

## **4. Software Setup**

### **4.1. Prerequisites:**

1. **Arduino IDE**: Download and install the Arduino IDE from [Arduino's official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Go to `Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries`.
   - Search for and install:
     - `ESP8266WiFi`
     - `ThingSpeak`
     - `Wire`

### **4.2. ThingSpeak Setup:**

1. **Create a ThingSpeak account** at [ThingSpeak.com](https://thingspeak.com/).
2. Create a new **channel** on ThingSpeak to log the accelerometer and gyroscope data.
3. Note down your **Channel Number** and **Write API Key** for your ThingSpeak channel. These will be used to send data from the ESP8266 to the ThingSpeak cloud.

## **5. Code Explanation**

### **5.1. Code Structure**

- **`main.ino`**: The main Arduino sketch for reading data from the MPU6050, processing it, and uploading it to ThingSpeak.
- **`config.h`**: A separate configuration file storing the WiFi credentials and ThingSpeak API keys, making it easier to update sensitive data without modifying the main code.

### **5.2. Code Flow**

1. **Setup**: Initializes I2C communication with the MPU6050 sensor and connects to WiFi.
2. **Data Reading**: Continuously reads accelerometer and gyroscope data from the MPU6050 sensor.
3. **Data Upload**: Sends the processed data to ThingSpeak every second using the ThingSpeak API.
4. **Error Handling**: Ensures robust I2C communication and retries WiFi connection in case of failure.

### **5.3. Key Functions**
- **MPU6050_Init()**: Configures the MPU6050 sensor (acceleration and gyroscope sensitivity settings).
- **Read_RawValue()**: Reads raw 14-byte data from the MPU6050 (3-axis acceleration, temperature, 3-axis gyroscope).
- **connectToWiFi()**: Handles WiFi connection setup and retry logic.
- **displayInfo()**: Sends accelerometer, gyroscope, and temperature data to ThingSpeak.

### **5.4. Code Customization**
In `config.h`, replace the following fields with your own data:
```cpp
const char* ssid = "YourWiFiSSID";
const char* password = "YourWiFiPassword";
const unsigned long myChannelNumber = 123456;
const char* myWriteAPIKey = "YourThingSpeakAPIKey";
```

## **6. Applications**

This setup can be used in a variety of real-world applications, including:

- **Motion Tracking**: Detect and monitor movement in 3D space for robotics, drones, or wearable devices.
- **Fitness Tracking**: Log activity data such as steps, orientation, and motion for health-monitoring applications.
- **Remote Monitoring**: Real-time sensor data can be monitored from anywhere via the ThingSpeak platform.
- **IoT-based Projects**: Combine multiple sensors with ThingSpeak for building an integrated IoT system for various fields, including industrial, home automation, and agriculture.

---

## **7. Troubleshooting**

- **No WiFi Connection**: Ensure your WiFi credentials are correct and that the ESP8266 is within range of your router.
- **Failed Data Upload**: Ensure the ThingSpeak API key and channel number are correct. You can use serial debugging to check the HTTP status codes returned by ThingSpeak.
- **MPU6050 Not Responding**: Verify wiring, particularly the SDA and SCL connections, and ensure the MPU6050 is powered with the correct voltage.

---

## **8. Further Improvements**

- **Low Power Mode**: Implement a low-power sleep mode to save battery when used in mobile applications.
- **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling and data validation before sending data to ThingSpeak.
- **Data Logging**: Store data locally (e.g., on an SD card) in addition to uploading it to ThingSpeak, in case of network issues.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Process the data in real-time for more complex applications like motion-based alarms or gesture recognition.

## **9. Conclusion**

This project provides a simple yet effective way to integrate a motion-tracking sensor with cloud-based data logging and monitoring via ThingSpeak. With a few tweaks, this project can serve as the foundation for various advanced IoT applications.
