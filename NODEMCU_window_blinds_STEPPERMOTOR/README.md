This code is for controlling a motorized **jalousie** (window blinds) using an **ESP8266** microcontroller. The system can accept WiFi credentials via a web interface, save them in the ESP's file system, and send or receive control commands over WiFi.

### Key Parts of the Code:

1. **Libraries and Definitions:**
   - `ESP8266WiFi.h`, `WiFiClient.h`, and `ESP8266WebServer.h`: Libraries for handling WiFi, HTTP requests, and web servers on the ESP8266.
   - `FS.h`: For handling the SPIFFS (SPI Flash File System) to read and write WiFi credentials.
   - Various constants define the pins, motor settings, server information, and timing values.

2. **Stepper Motor Control:**
   - Three pins control a stepper motor: `STEPPER_EN_PIN`, `STEPPER_DIR_PIN`, and `STEPPER_STEP_PIN`.
   - `moveStepper(steps, direction)` controls the motor to rotate a given number of steps in the specified direction (open or close the blinds).
   - `jalousieOpen()` and `jalousieClose()` are high-level functions to open and close the blinds by moving the stepper motor.
   - `jalousieHome()` brings the blinds to their initial state (closed).

3. **WiFi Setup:**
   - WiFi credentials (SSID and password) are read from a file (`/wifi.txt`). If the credentials are valid, the ESP8266 connects to the WiFi.
   - If no credentials are found or connection fails, the ESP8266 starts in Access Point mode, allowing users to connect to a web interface to enter WiFi credentials.
   - These credentials are saved to the file system and used for future connections.

4. **Web Server:**
   - When the ESP8266 is in AP mode, a web server serves a form to collect WiFi credentials. Once submitted, the credentials are stored, and the ESP8266 reboots to connect to the WiFi network.
   - The `handleWiFiCredentials()` function handles the form submission by saving the SSID and password.

5. **WiFi Client (in `loop()`):**
   - After connecting to the WiFi, the ESP8266 regularly sends HTTP requests to a remote server (`example.com`) to check for commands.
   - If the server responds with the command `open`, the blinds open. If the server responds with `close`, the blinds close.
   - If no command is received or the server does not respond, the system waits and checks again.

### Main Functions:

- **`setup()`**: 
  - Initializes serial communication, motor control pins, and the file system.
  - Tries to load and connect using saved WiFi credentials. If unsuccessful, it starts an access point for new credentials.
  - Initializes the motor by moving it to its home position.

- **`loop()`**:
  - Every `SERVER_CONNECTION_INTERVAL` (10 seconds), the ESP8266 checks for commands from the server.
  - If the server sends `open` or `close`, the respective function (`jalousieOpen()` or `jalousieClose()`) is triggered.

### Summary:
This program allows the ESP8266 to control window blinds using a stepper motor. It connects to a WiFi network using credentials entered through a web interface and checks a remote server for commands to open or close the blinds.
