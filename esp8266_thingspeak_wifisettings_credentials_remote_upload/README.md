### What the Code Does

This code sets up a **Wi-Fi manager**, **web server**, and **sensor data logger** on an **ESP8266**, allowing the device to log temperature and humidity readings (from a **DHT11** sensor) to **ThingSpeak**, a cloud service for data logging and visualization. 

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of its key functionalities:

---

### 1. **Libraries Used**

- **EEPROM.h**: Emulates EEPROM storage on ESP8266.
- **ESP8266WiFi.h**: Manages Wi-Fi connections.
- **ESP8266WebServer.h**: Handles HTTP server functionalities.
- **WiFiManager.h**: A library that helps with Wi-Fi management (automatically reconnecting or creating an AP for configuration).
- **FS.h**: Provides access to the flash storage system (SPIFFS) for storing files.
- **ArduinoJson.h**: For reading and writing configuration files in JSON format.
- **DHTesp.h**: Manages the DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity readings.

---

### 2. **Configuration and Global Variables**

- **DHT11 Sensor**:
  - Uses GPIO14 (D5 on the NodeMCU) to read temperature and humidity data.
  
- **EEPROM**:
  - Stores API key, interval, and enable flag.
  
- **ThingSpeak**:
  - Uses `api.thingspeak.com` to upload temperature and humidity data through an HTTP GET request.

- **Web Server**:
  - Set up to handle client requests and serve configuration files from the ESP's file system (SPIFFS).

### 3. **WiFiManager Setup**

The **WiFiManager** handles connecting the ESP8266 to a Wi-Fi network or creating an access point if it can't connect. If it starts the access point, you can configure the Wi-Fi credentials via a web interface.

- **saveConfigCallback()**: Flags when configuration changes need to be saved.
  
- **ReadConfig()**: Loads Wi-Fi credentials and other settings from a `config.json` file stored in SPIFFS.

- **WiFiManagerSetup()**:
  - Mounts SPIFFS to load configuration settings.
  - Connects to Wi-Fi using **WiFiManager** and, if not successful, it starts an access point named "AutoConnectAP".

---

### 4. **Web Server Functionality**

- **serve configuration files**: Uses `handleFileRead()` to serve configuration files like `settings.htm`.
- **Response Handlers**:
  - `/settings`: Accepts API key and interval values via POST requests.
  - `/getSettings`: Sends the current settings (API key, interval, enable flag) in JSON format via GET requests.
  
The server serves the necessary files to allow the user to configure API keys and intervals through the web interface.

---

### 5. **ThingSpeak HTTP Requests**

- **makeHTTPRequest()**:
  - Reads the current temperature and humidity values from the DHT11 sensor.
  - Sends these values to the ThingSpeak server via an HTTP GET request with fields representing temperature and humidity.
  - Retries if the connection fails.

---

### 6. **Main Loop**
  
- The main loop continuously:
  - Serves client requests via the HTTP server.
  - Periodically checks if the set interval has passed.
  - If the interval is valid and enabled, the code sends sensor data to ThingSpeak.

### Code Improvements

1. **Refactor SPIFFS Access**:
   - Replace **SPIFFS** with **LittleFS**, as it is more modern and reliable for file storage on the ESP8266.

2. **Wi-Fi Reconnect Handling**:
   - Add a reconnection mechanism if Wi-Fi is lost after an initial connection.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     if (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
       Serial.println("Reconnecting to WiFi...");
       WiFiManagerSetup();
     }
     ```

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Improve error handling, especially for failed sensor readings and HTTP requests.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     if (isnan(temperatureC) || isnan(humidity)) {
       Serial.println("Failed to read from DHT sensor");
       return;
     }
     ```

4. **Optimize EEPROM Usage**:
   - EEPROM can wear out if written too frequently. Only commit EEPROM data when necessary.
     ```cpp
     if (shouldSaveConfig) {
       EEPROM.commit();
       shouldSaveConfig = false;
     }
     ```

5. **Non-blocking Delays**:
   - Replace the blocking `delay()` calls with non-blocking delays using `millis()` to avoid halting the entire program.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     unsigned long previousMillis = 0;
     const long interval = 10000;  // 10 seconds
     if (millis() - previousMillis >= interval) {
       previousMillis = millis();
       // code to execute every 10 seconds
     }
     ```

### Explanation of Core Functions:

1. **ReadConfig()**: 
   Reads the stored configuration (such as API key and interval) from SPIFFS into the `data` structure.

2. **WiFiManagerSetup()**:
   Attempts to connect to the saved Wi-Fi credentials or starts an AP for configuring Wi-Fi if no connection is found.

3. **makeHTTPRequest()**:
   Sends an HTTP GET request to **ThingSpeak** to log the temperature and humidity data read from the DHT11 sensor.

4. **bindValues()**:
   Sends the stored API key, interval, and enable flag back to the client as a JSON object.

With these improvements, the code would become more robust, easier to manage, and better suited for long-term operation. Let me know if you need further customization!
