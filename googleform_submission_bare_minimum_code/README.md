This code is used to submit data to a Google Form using a Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller (such as an ESP8266 or ESP32). It utilizes the **FCGF (Form Connected Google Form)** library, which facilitates direct submissions to Google Forms via Wi-Fi. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of each part of the code and its functionality:

---

### 1. **Library Inclusion**

```cpp
#include <FCGF.h>
```
- The `FCGF.h` library is included, which simplifies communication between a Wi-Fi-enabled board (e.g., ESP8266, ESP32, or Arduino MKR GSM 1400) and Google Forms. It allows the board to submit form data over the internet.

### 2. **Google Form Class Declaration**

```cpp
GoogleForm gf;
```
- The object `gf` of class `GoogleForm` is created. This object will handle the process of submitting data to the Google Form.

---

### 3. **Wi-Fi Credentials**

```cpp
const char* your_wifi_ssid = "swapnil2@4";
const char* your_wifi_password = "TPS@462016";
```
- `your_wifi_ssid`: The SSID (network name) of the Wi-Fi network that the board will connect to.
- `your_wifi_password`: The password for the Wi-Fi network.

These credentials are used to connect the microcontroller to a local Wi-Fi network.

### 4. **Google Form Data**

```cpp
int num_of_inputs = 2;
String myform_privateid = "14vzNW3nECSlXMw3IGA0BOlwvvfrtt7benGkbb0FCsf0";
String myform_inputs[] = {"entry.83139747","entry.1317737190"};
```
- `num_of_inputs`: Specifies the number of inputs in the Google Form, which in this case is 2.
- `myform_privateid`: The unique ID of the Google Form. Every Google Form has a unique ID, and this ID is used to identify the form to which the data will be submitted.
- `myform_inputs[]`: These are the entry IDs of the form fields. In Google Forms, each input field is assigned a unique identifier (e.g., `entry.83139747` for one input and `entry.1317737190` for another). These IDs allow the code to correctly map values to the respective form fields.

---

### 5. **Setup Function**

```cpp
void setup() {
  FCGF_DEBUG = true;           // Enable serial debugging for version 0.0.4 and above
  Serial.begin(9600);          // Initialize serial communication at a baud rate of 9600
  
  // Connect to Wi-Fi using the credentials and initialize Google Form submission capabilities
  gf.beginWiFi(your_wifi_ssid, your_wifi_password);
}
```
- **Debugging Mode (`FCGF_DEBUG = true`)**: This enables debugging output via the serial monitor to help with troubleshooting, displaying important data such as connection status and form submission feedback.
- **Serial Communication (`Serial.begin(9600)`)**: Initializes serial communication at 9600 baud. This allows you to view output messages in the Serial Monitor.
- **Wi-Fi Connection (`gf.beginWiFi`)**: This function attempts to connect the board to the Wi-Fi network using the provided SSID (`your_wifi_ssid`) and password (`your_wifi_password`). If the connection is successful, the board can start sending data over the internet.

### 6. **Main Loop**

```cpp
void loop() {
  String myform_values[] = {"yourval_0", "yourval_1"};
  
  gf.submit(myform_privateid, myform_inputs, myform_values, num_of_inputs, 1);
}
```
- **Data Assignment (`myform_values[]`)**: The array `myform_values[]` contains the actual data that will be submitted to the Google Form fields. In this example, the array has two values: `"yourval_0"` and `"yourval_1"`. These values are placeholders and can be replaced with any data you want to submit (such as sensor readings, user inputs, etc.).
  
- **Form Submission (`gf.submit()`)**: This is the core function of the loop, which sends data to the Google Form. The function accepts the following parameters:
  1. **Private ID of the form (`myform_privateid`)**: The unique ID of the Google Form.
  2. **Input IDs (`myform_inputs`)**: The form field identifiers where the data will be submitted.
  3. **Input values (`myform_values`)**: The actual values corresponding to the input fields.
  4. **Number of inputs (`num_of_inputs`)**: The number of inputs to submit.
  5. **Delay (`1`)**: A delay between submissions, ensuring the submission is not too fast for the server. This is especially important to avoid submitting too frequently and getting blocked by Google.

### Additional Notes:

- **Looping Behavior**: The loop continuously submits the data to the Google Form. In a practical scenario, you may want to limit the frequency of submissions (e.g., by adding a `delay()` function or submitting only when new data is available).

### Applications:

This code can be used in various IoT projects where you need to collect and log data remotely in a Google Form. Some example use cases include:

1. **Sensor Data Logging**:
   - Submit sensor data such as temperature, humidity, or air quality readings directly to a Google Form for real-time data logging and analysis.

2. **User Feedback**:
   - Collect feedback or input from a user via sensors or buttons and automatically submit it to a Google Form.

3. **Automated Surveys**:
   - Automatically submit survey responses or system data to a Google Form for later analysis.

4. **Remote Monitoring**:
   - Set up a system where sensor data from remote locations (e.g., weather stations, greenhouses, or industrial sensors) is sent periodically to a Google Form for tracking and analysis.

This system enables a low-cost, cloud-based data storage solution using Google Forms and can be integrated into a wide variety of IoT projects for data collection and automation.
