### 1. **Reduce Web Server Overhead:**
   - **Use `F()` macro**: It stores strings in Flash memory to save RAM, which is limited on the ESP8266.
   - **Optimize web page generation**: The web page generation could be optimized further, but for simplicity, itâ€™s still acceptable.

### Key Changes:
1. **Modular Functions**: 
   - Created `initGPIO()` and `handleGPIO()` functions for GPIO setup and control.
2. **Constants for States**: 
   - Used `STATE_ON` and `STATE_OFF` constants for state management.
3. **Memory Optimization**: 
   - Used the `F()` macro to store constant strings in flash memory, which helps reduce RAM usage.
4. **General Clean-Up**: 
   - Made minor formatting adjustments for readability.
The code sets up an **ESP8266** as a simple web server that controls two GPIO pins through a web interface. Users can toggle the state of the pins (turn them on or off) by interacting with buttons on a webpage served by the ESP8266. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

### 1. **Libraries and Initialization:**
   - **`#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>`**: This library allows the ESP8266 to connect to a Wi-Fi network.
   - **`#include <DNSServer.h>`**, **`<ESP8266WebServer.h>`**, and **`<WiFiManager.h>`**: These libraries manage the web server and help with Wi-Fi configuration. The **WiFiManager** library simplifies connecting to a Wi-Fi network by creating an access point (AP) when no known network is available, allowing users to configure Wi-Fi credentials.

### 2. **Setting Up GPIO and Web Server:**
   - **GPIO 5 and GPIO 4**: These pins are set up as output pins (used to control external devices like LEDs, relays, etc.).
   - **Web server initialization**: A web server is set up to listen on port 80 (the default HTTP port).

### 3. **WiFiManager for Wi-Fi Setup:**
   - **WiFiManager** automatically handles connecting to Wi-Fi:
     - If the ESP8266 finds saved Wi-Fi credentials, it tries to connect.
     - If it fails to connect or no credentials are saved, it creates an access point (AP) called "AutoConnectAP," where the user can connect and configure the ESP8266's Wi-Fi credentials.
   - After successful Wi-Fi connection, the web server starts.

### 4. **Main Loop - Handling Client Requests:**
   - The **main loop** continuously checks for incoming client requests to the ESP8266 (like a web browser visiting the ESP8266's IP address).
   - When a client connects, the ESP8266 reads the HTTP request and checks if the request contains certain URLs (`/5/on`, `/5/off`, `/4/on`, `/4/off`).
     - If the request contains `/5/on`, GPIO 5 is turned **on** (HIGH), and the web interface will display it as **on**.
     - If the request contains `/5/off`, GPIO 5 is turned **off** (LOW).
     - Similarly, GPIO 4 is controlled by URLs `/4/on` and `/4/off`.

### 5. **Sending HTML Response to the Client:**
   - After processing the client request, the ESP8266 responds by sending an HTML webpage to the client.
   - The webpage shows the current state of GPIO 5 and GPIO 4 (on or off) and provides buttons to toggle their states:
     - If the current state is **off**, the page displays an **ON** button.
     - If the current state is **on**, the page displays an **OFF** button.

### 6. **Optimizations:**
   - The `F()` macro is used to store constant strings (like HTML code) in flash memory instead of RAM, which is important because the ESP8266 has limited RAM.
   - Functions like `initGPIO()` and `handleGPIO()` improve code modularity and readability.

### **How the Web Server Works:**
1. **Client Connection**: A web browser connects to the ESP8266 by typing its IP address.
2. **Request Handling**: The ESP8266 reads the HTTP request (URL) sent by the browser.
3. **Control GPIOs**: If the URL contains specific commands (`/5/on`, `/5/off`, etc.), the corresponding GPIO pin is turned on or off.
4. **Send Web Page**: The ESP8266 generates and sends a simple HTML page to the browser, showing the current state of the GPIOs and providing buttons to toggle them.
5. **Loop**: This process repeats for every new client connection.

### **Summary**:
- The ESP8266 hosts a web server that lets users control two GPIO pins (connected to external devices like LEDs, motors, or relays) via a simple webpage.
- The WiFiManager simplifies the process of connecting the ESP8266 to Wi-Fi, creating a fallback access point if no known networks are available.
