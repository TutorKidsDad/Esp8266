This code controls an LED strip using the **FastLED** library and changes the color of the strip based on an analog input. Here's a breakdown:

### Key Libraries and Setup:
1. **FastLED Library**: 
   - Controls the WS2812 LED strip.
   - `#include <FastLED.h>` is necessary to use FastLED functions.
   
2. **Constants Defined**:
   - `NUM_LEDS = 8`: The number of LEDs in the strip.
   - `DATA_PIN = D7`: Pin connected to the LED strip.
   - `ANALOG_PIN = A0`: Pin used for reading analog input (likely from a sensor, like a potentiometer or other analog sensor).
   - `BRIGHTNESS = 128`: Sets the brightness of the LEDs (out of 255).

3. **LED Array Declaration**:
   - `CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS]`: Creates an array to store the color data for each of the 8 LEDs.

### `setup()` function:
1. **FastLED Initialization**:
   - `FastLED.addLeds<WS2812, DATA_PIN, GRB>(leds, NUM_LEDS)`: This initializes the WS2812 LEDs on the specified pin (`D7`) with the GRB color format.
   - `FastLED.setBrightness(BRIGHTNESS)`: Sets the brightness of the LEDs.

2. **Serial Communication**: 
   - `Serial.begin(115200)`: Initializes the serial communication at a baud rate of 115200 for debugging or reading the analog values.

### `loop()` function:
1. **Analog Value Reading**:
   - `int analogValue = analogRead(ANALOG_PIN)`: Reads the value from the analog pin (`A0`). The value is between 0 and 1023, based on the sensor or input connected.

2. **Color Definitions**:
   - Predefined colors (Red, Orange, Green) are created using `CRGB` objects with RGB values:
     - `colorRed = CRGB(255, 0, 0)` is pure red.
     - `colorOrange = CRGB(255, 165, 0)` is orange.
     - `colorGreen = CRGB(0, 255, 0)` is green.

3. **Color Selection Based on Analog Input**:
   - The analog value is used to select a color:
     - **0 to 300**: Set the LEDs to red.
     - **301 to 650**: Set the LEDs to orange.
     - **651 to 1023**: Set the LEDs to green.

4. **LED Update**:
   - `fill_solid(leds, NUM_LEDS, color)`: Fills all the LEDs in the array with the selected color.
   - `FastLED.show()`: Sends the color data to the LED strip, making the changes visible.
   - `delay(100)`: A delay to make color transitions smoother.

### Summary:
The analog input ( from a sensor or potentiometer) controls the color of an LED strip. Depending on the value of the input, the LEDs will display red, orange, or green. The color transitions happen smoothly thanks to small delays between each update.
