This code integrates several sensors (GPS, air quality, temperature, and humidity) with WiFi to send sensor data to the ThingSpeak IoT platform for monitoring and analysis. Here's a brief breakdown of what it does:

### Components and Libraries:
1. **Libraries**:
   - `TinyGPSPlus.h`: For handling GPS data.
   - `SoftwareSerial.h`: For setting up a serial communication link with the GPS module.
   - `ThingSpeak.h`: For sending data to the ThingSpeak platform.
   - `ESP8266WiFi.h`: To connect to WiFi using the ESP8266 module.
   - `MQ135.h`: For air quality sensor data.
   - `DHT.h`: For temperature and humidity sensor (DHT22).

2. **WiFi and ThingSpeak Credentials**:
   - `ssid` and `pass` store WiFi credentials.
   - `apiKey`, `server`, and `myChannelNumber` store credentials for ThingSpeak communication.

### Setup:
- **GPS**: The GPS module is set up using SoftwareSerial on pins D1 and D2, with a baud rate of 9600.
- **WiFi**: The ESP8266 connects to the specified WiFi network.
- **ThingSpeak**: Initializes a connection to the ThingSpeak platform using the `WiFiClient`.
- **Sensors**: The DHT22 (for temperature and humidity) and MQ135 (for air quality) sensors are initialized.

### Loop (main functionality):
- Every 20 seconds, the following steps occur:
  1. **Sensor Readings**: 
     - `readSensors()` collects air quality, temperature, and humidity data.
     - `readGPSData()` fetches the GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude).
  2. **Send Data to ThingSpeak**:
     - The `sendDataToThingSpeak()` function packages the collected data and sends it to the ThingSpeak platform using `ThingSpeak.writeFields()`.
  3. **GPS Processing**:
     - Continuously reads incoming GPS data to ensure it's up to date.

If the GPS isn't detected, an error message is printed after 5 seconds.

### Key Functions:
- **sendDataToThingSpeak()**: Sends the sensor data (air quality, temperature, humidity, latitude, and longitude) to ThingSpeak.
- **readGPSData()**: Checks if valid GPS data is available and retrieves the latitude and longitude.
- **readSensors()**: Collects air quality (PPM), temperature, and humidity readings.

### Error Handling:
- It checks for valid readings from both the DHT sensor (temperature, humidity) and the GPS module. If invalid data is detected, it prints error messages to the serial monitor.

### Summary:
The code continuously gathers data from various sensors (air quality, temperature, humidity, GPS) and uploads the information to the ThingSpeak platform every 20 seconds. This allows for remote monitoring of environmental conditions, including GPS location.
